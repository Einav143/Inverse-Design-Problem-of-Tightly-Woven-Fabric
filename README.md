Code files for the paper - The Inverse Design Problem of Tightly Woven Fabrics

**constrained_optimization.py**: Computes two planar orthogonal curves and minimizes the total arclength while enforcing a minimum pairwise distance constraint between every sampled point on the two curves in 3D. Uses SciPy’s SLSQP to solve the constrained optimization and writes the optimized profiles in outputs/

**woven_fabric_optimization.jl**: Optimizes the geometry of a woven-fabric “unit cell” by treating each yarn as a discretized 3D curve and minimizing the total energy, while imposing periodic boundary conditions. The script initializes two interlaced sinusoidal threads (row/column directions), then minimizes a total energy consisting of (i) stretching penalties for deviations from prescribed rest segment lengths, (ii) bending penalties based on angles between consecutive segments (scaled by a bending stiffness kb and thread radius r), and (iii) a smooth repulsion barrier between the two threads to prevent interpenetration. It uses Optim.jl with gradient descent, visualizes the initial vs optimized unit cell with GLMakie, and saves the final thread coordinates to a timestamped text file under results/.
